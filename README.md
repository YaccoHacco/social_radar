## Inspiration

We were inspired by the use of community features such as Snapchat school communities, community chats such as YikYak, and features from Facebook such as groups and marketplace.

## What it does

SocialRadar allows local communities to get in touch via a system called **SocialPoints**. If someone is out in the community and there is a notable event occurring they can make a social point within a football field radius around them that details this event so other people can see it.

Such events could be community events like football games, concerts, farmers markets, and other get togethers.

Businesses can also create business points, that users can interact with and see information posted by the business.

The user of the app can see any social/business point within 10 miles of their current location, which is perfect for the city of Manhattan.

These social points can be commented on so that people can interact with unique events happening around them.

There is also a generic chat that contains chats within the same radius as the SocialPoints system

There is also a marketplace operating on the SocialPoints system but it does not give the sellers address until the sale is confirmed to occur via a DM from the buyer to the seller. These purchases are facilitated either in person with cash, or via FLOW/Hedera cryptocurrency.

## How we built it

We used the Google Maps API via **Google Cloud** services to implement the map, and a live API to retrieve the prices of **FLOW** and **Hedera/HBAR**. Adobe Illustrator was used to create the graphics for the app, including the logo.

## Challenges we ran into

We had never used any Google Cloud service before this so it was a challenge to get the Maps API implemented in the project. Continuously creating fetch calls for the Crypto API was also a tough challenge for us. Focusing on making the user interface appealing while also being functional was also a big challenge for this app. It was also tough to come up with an innovative name and logo for our app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud with how far we were able to get with the app, as we thought that we were being overzealous with the features of the app. The custom markers on the map were a big accomplishment as using the Maps API was a bit involved. We are also proud of our time management and the number of features we were able to add in the time allowed.

## What we learned

- The complexities of web development
- The use cases of different APIs, including cryptocurrency focused APIs
- The value of blockchain technology, even if we were not able to fully implement it before the deadline

## What's next for SocialRadar

- Implement the blockchain features behind the cryptocurrency of the marketplace
- Implement the ability to direct message other users of the app
